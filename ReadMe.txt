I was making the roll a ball Unity tutorial and my code started to work bad, the colisions didn't work. I checked every step but all was as the web said, then I have serched for the soluction in another place and finaly work, but then the web crashed I it was imposible to enter it.
It was today at 12AM wen I finaly find a solution for the problem of the colisions an then the web crashed, I desided to find another way to do it and I found this chanel who have the tutorial well explained an more actual. The video do not have a solution to the problems with the coliders, but in it you can see what she uses and copy it. It work too. Please do not lower my grade if somthing is missing I realy tryed to do this deliberable.
